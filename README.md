## Project Description
Letterboxd is a social media platform for film lovers, where users can log, rate, review, and discuss movies. The platform includes features like user profiles, movie ratings, reviews, lists, and social interactions. Our SQL program aims to store and organize this data for easy retrieval.

Query 1 allows the managers to see which accounts are inactive. It is expensive to run a platform with many users, so by deleting any inactive accounts, the managers are able to cut down on costs. The deletion of inactive users also improves the security of the platform, as these accounts tend to be more susceptible to hacking.

2. Query 2 retrieves billing history of users. As well as counting the number of subscriptions the user has had throughout their enrollment. For example, if a user had a free account and then upgraded to a paid subsription. The query then totals the total amount billed to users as of current date.
