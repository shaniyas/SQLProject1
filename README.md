1. Query 1 displays the list of users who made their account before 2024 and have not written any reviews yet. Query 1 allows the managers to see which accounts are inactive. It is expensive to run a platform with many users, so by deleting any inactive accounts, the managers are able to cut down on costs. The deletion of inactive users also improves the security of the platform, as these accounts tend to be more susceptible to hacking.

2. Query 2 displays the total amount of revenue made from users from countries outside of America, with the results grouped by country. A manager may want to know which countries they should promote more in. Knowing which countries generate the most revenue, may also give the manager an idea of what regions they should expand the platform to.

3. Query 3 retrieves the billing history of users. As well as counting the number of subscriptions the user has had throughout their enrollment. For example, if a user had a free account and then upgraded to a paid subsription. The query then totals the total amount billed to users as of current date.

4. Query 4 presents the number of users per subscription tier, there are three tiers comprising of free, pro, and patron.
   
5. This query presents Users who have left more than 2 reviews and have had their account since January 5th.
